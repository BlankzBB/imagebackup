## What you will need:
Every package you need *should* come with the latest python version. 
In certain circumstances zlib can be missing, which is used for compression.

## what you need to change:

### picDir (line 7)
This is the archive the script will be scanning. make sure there is a **/** on the end of the variable

### archiveDir (line 8)
This is where the archive will be stored. make sure there is a **/** at the end of the variable

## what you can change:

### seconds (line 6)
this will determine how often it will scan the directory. 

### archiveName
the name of the archive.

### compression
whether or not the program will compress the zip file.
